You've found my collection of past and upcoming public speaking engagements. A good speaker always has their audience's best interest at heart. My goal is to educate, inspire, motivate and entertain. If you have an upcoming conference or meetup that you think I would be a good fit for, please contact me.

### We Need Someone Technical on the Call

time and acing the follow through. 

This talk was not recorded but a joy to give. I'd love to give it again. Please contact me.

### I'm Altering the Deal
_ParisRB 2020_

Imagine your legacy production Ruby application is highly dependent on a third-party API as you learn your vendor 
deprecates your current connection. What do you do when you're forced to make a change? Accept the challenge by 
embracing abstractions, switching libraries, feature flags, edge-case testing while developing new features. Game on.

### Hire Me: I'm Excellent At Quitting
_Rubyconf 2019_

You have the right to be happy at work — why would we want it to be any other way? As our careers as Ruby developers 
flourish, amazing new opportunities will require you to quit a job that you may love or loathe. It's OK to quit. 
If you want to learn how to gracefully leave your job with a solid game plan, an educated successor, and without 
burning bridges, this talk is for you.

### Draw A Crowd
_Isle of Ruby 2018 | Railsconf 2018_

Contextual Camouflage is an open-source gallery art installation built in RoR that guides visitors to anonymously report 
mental health disorders that affect themselves or their relationships. After users submit a disorder, they have the 
option to include anecdotes and demographic data for intervention researchers. The data is molded into an interactive 
real-time display using ActionCable. Come see how code can double as art and an educational tool.
