### Co-Host of The Ruby on Rails Podcast

As a long time listener of the podcast, I came on as a rotating co-host in 2018. Eventually, I took over as a solo 
host, using the platform to speak to my heroes in the Ruby, Rails, open source and technology space. In 2021, I took
the podcast independent and brought on 3 co-hosts: Brian, Jemma and Nick. A personal goal of ours is to elevate voices 
that have not been heard in our community yet.

### Ruby Tapas | Serverless Ruby with AWS Lambda

For some software applications, even a microservice architecture feels too heavyweight. Sometimes all you really need to implement a bit of new functionality is a single function that takes some inputs and produces some outputs. In those cases, wouldn’t it be nice to simply upload the function into the cloud, and let someone else worry about triggering and scaling it? That’s the value proposition of so-called “serverless” computing. In today’s episode, guest chef Brittany Martin is going to show you everything you need to know to get started with serverless architecture in Ruby, using Amazon’s Lambda service.
